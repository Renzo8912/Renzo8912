## Hi there 👋

I'm Rene, A Software Engineering Student learning how to create stuff.

I build apps from Swift & Flutter, got a background to C++, Python and Java.

I use tools like VS Studio, Xcode, Android Studio, n8n (still new) and Jupyter Notebooks.

I am still learning n8n, LineGraph, Orange and many more soon to IoT (Excited about it).

I prioritize my academics at the time of writing this but I do look at my linkedin notifications if you want to reach out.

Fun fact: Since March 25th 2020, I have been recording every travel history, 
my travel history is now 900+ as of January 2026 complete with timestamps and the number of times I go to university.
